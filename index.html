                    <p class="dogcolumn2">The German Shepherd Dog, also known as the Alsatian, is a German
                        breed of working dog of medium to
                        large size. The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German
                        herding
                        dogs from 1899. <br><br>
                        It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other
                        types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work and warfare. It
                        is
                        commonly kept as a companion dog.</p>

                <p class="data">
                    German Shepherds were bred specifically for their intelligence. In a list of breeds most likely to
                    bark as watchdogs, Stanley Coren ranked the breed in second place. Coupled with their strength, this
                    trait makes the breed desirable as police, guard and search and rescue dogs, as they are able to
                    quickly learn various tasks and interpret instructions better than other breeds.

                <p class="data">
                    German Shepherds are moderately active dogs and are described in breed standards as self assured.
                    The breed is marked by a willingness to learn and an eagerness to have a purpose. They are curious,
                    which makes them excellent guard dogs and suitable for search missions. They can become
                    overprotective of their family and territory, especially if not socialised correctly. They are not
                    inclined to become immediate friends with strangers. German Shepherds are highly intelligent and
                    obedient, as well as protective of their owners.

                        was developed in the United Kingdom from fishing dogs imported from the colony of Newfoundland,
                        and was named after the Labrador region of that colony. It is among
                        the most commonly kept dogs in several countries, particularly in the Western world. <br><br>
                        The Labrador is loyal, obedient and playful. It was bred as a sporting and hunting dog, but is
                        widely kept as a companion dog. It may also be trained as a guide or assistance dog, or for
                        rescue or therapy work.</p>

                    Labradors have a reputation as a very even-tempered breed and an excellent family dog. This

                    <p class="dogcolumn2">The Rottweiler is a robust working breed of great strength descended from the
                        mastiffs of the Roman legions. <br><br> The dogs were known in German as Rottweiler Metzgerhund,
                        meaning Rottweil butchers' dogs, because their main use was to herd livestock and pull carts
                        laden with butchered meat to market. This continued until the mid-19th century when railways
                        replaced droving. Although still used to herd stock in many parts of the world, Rottweilers are
                        now also used as search and rescue dogs, guard dogs, and police dogs.</p>

                <p class="data">
                    Unsurprising to many Rottie fans, Rottweilers are one of the most intelligent breeds. Unlike other
                    dogs, Rotties score highly in all three branches, placing them in the top 10 most intelligent dog
                    breeds by most expert tests and standards.
                <div class="subheading">Temperament</div>
                <p class="data">
                    The Rottweiler is good-natured, placid in basic disposition, very devoted, obedient, biddable and
                    eager to work. His appearance is natural and rustic, his behaviour self-assured, steady and
                    fearless. He reacts to his surroundings with great alertness and at the same time even-tempered.
                    <br>
                    In the American Kennel Club's "Official Standard of the Rottweiler," the Rottweiler's temperament
                    should be

                    a calm, confident and courageous dog with a self-assured aloofness that does not lend itself to
                    immediate and indiscriminate friendships. A Rottweiler is self-confident and responds quietly and
                    with a wait-and-see attitude to influences in its environment. It has an inherent desire to protect
                    home and family, and is an intelligent dog of extreme hardness and adaptability with a strong
                    willingness to work, making them especially suited as a companion, guardian and general all-purpose
                    dog.
